    Hello
    Currently this is an untracked file to save it to git use git add . or git add index.html
    Now we will see how to commit
    git commit -m"ANY MESSAGE" -m"2nd message"
    Here first message will be added to Title of message and other message will be added to description box below it
    Now this is still not live yet to make it live in our repository we will use git push
    Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit. This means in our code editor we are one step ahead compared to  our git hub
    we use git commit -m "Any meaningful message" to commit changes in github.
